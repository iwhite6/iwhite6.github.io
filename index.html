        <h1>Simple Web Calculator</h1>
        
        <p>
            For my project, I'm going to create a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The main goal is to build a calculator that can handle basic arithmetic. It will have a clean interface with number buttons (0-9) and buttons for the standard operations: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. I'll also include a display at the top that shows the numbers as you type them and the final answer, just like a real calculator. Of course, I'll add a clear button to reset everything.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make it a bit better, I'm planning to add a couple of enhanced features. First, I want to make it work with the keyboard, so you can just type in your math problem instead of having to click all the buttons. I also think it would be cool to add basic memory functions, like an "M+" button to add the current number to memory and an "M−" button to subtract from it.
